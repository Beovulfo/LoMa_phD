% To do list with the code

Priority/Issue
#1 - Implement INITIAL CONDITION from Matlab like Roger&Moser
Using the OSSQ.m files try to calculate all fields in order to
compute energy

#
###1- Check implementation of explicit time step scheme RK3
DONE -- all converge to the same curve! :)

#2- Post process -> check with Oscar, matlab functions or using the fortran code, etc..
   ---Waiting for some codes regardings this issue
 
- Improve mesh 
  - we want a mesh accurated enough in the shear layer and in the extrems.
  - Remesh scaling the shear layer thickness to be 1 and the y domain 4 times this thickness?
  - One way to proceed in order to set the mesh is:
     - run a simulation wiht a initial mesh-> obtain energy dissipation = f(y), calculate kolmogorov scale for this eps(y)
     - mesh around 5 times this scale aprox. eps=nu (dUi/dXi)^2




X DONE:Check carefully VISC, in order to find what causes the NaN
   * About this it has been proved that the old code with new rk00 works with couette BC's
     the old code with this check is located on hall9000:~/SVN_341/ 
     + VISC had input variables as real8 instead of real4, changed and working!
     + used /test folder in order to check rk00 and visc --> both working with couette BC's
X DONE Running couette_poly, check if the results are coherent.
X DONE check VISC with robin BC's for mixing layer
