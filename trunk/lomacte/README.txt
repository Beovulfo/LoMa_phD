AAF
this version of code works for constant coefficients and density ratios 
smaller than 2.7.
Need of 2 other programs:
1) initloma : Fortran code that creates initial turbulent conditions for any
density ratio wanted (hre.dat will set parameters of IC).
2) tofis_loma: transform Fourier results of not nice variables to physical
space of velocity, temperature, etc...
